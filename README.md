# Model Evaluation and Validation

Data samples are prepared and analized. A few classifier models are created
and then they are evaluated and validated with Sklearn library.

### Learn

* We evaluate 3 different data samples
* We train Models using some algorithms with scikit:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Neural Networks
    * Decision Tree
    * Support Vector Machines
* We make our prediction on each model 
* We test different Evaluation Metrics:
    * Accuracy
    * Mean Absolut Error
    * Mean Squared Error
    * R2 Score
* We implement Cross Validation
* We detect Overfitting and Underfitting
* We apply Grid Search
